# Wiki

*Why not to use the GitHub Wiki feature.*

<br>

## Problems

#### Folders

Wiki pages cannot be sorted into folders <br>
and thus they inevitably become a mess. 

#### Links

Relative links to for example images don't work <br>
on wiki pages, this means you will end up with <br>
markdown cluttered full of long absolute links.
    
#### Contributing

Wikis have a separate version history <br>
and cannot easily be contributed to <br>
as you would to a normal repository.

<br>
<br>

## Alternative

#### Recommended

Simply create a  `/Documentation/`  folder.

#### Branches

If you want to separate the documentation completely <br>
you may want to create a `Documentation` branch.

#### Enterprise

In case you have a lot of documentation and <br>
yourrepository is part of an organization, you <br>
could also create a dedicated repository for it.
